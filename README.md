httpclient-jarcache===================httpclient-jarcache is a HttpCacheStorage provider for Apache HTTPClient that allows you to provide a 'warm' cache backed byresources bundled in a JAR file.This allows for usage of libraries depending on Apache HTTP Client,but bypassing any network connectivity requirement when selectedresources can be provided from the classpath. This library was primarily developed for use with the JSONLD-Javalibrary, but can be used with any library that allows controlof which HttpClient instance is to be used.Mapping of resources to classpath---------------------------------The JarCacheStorage reads `/jarcache.json` from the classpath, which structureshould mimic:	[		{			"Content-Location": "http://nonexisting.example.com/",			"X-Classpath": "helloworld.html",			"Content-Type": "text/html"		},		{			"Content-Location": "http://nonexisting.example.com/other.jpg",			"X-Classpath": "folder/other.jpeg",			"Content-Type": "image/jpeg"		}	]Usage with JSONLD-Java----------------------	public class MyExample { 		    static {		JarCacheStorage cacheStorage = new JarCacheStorage(				MyExample.class.getClassLoader());		synchronized (DocumentLoader.class) {			HttpClient oldHttpClient = DocumentLoader.getHttpClient();			CachingHttpClient wrappedHttpClient = new CachingHttpClient(					oldHttpClient, cacheStorage, cacheStorage.getCacheConfig());			DocumentLoader.setHttpClient(wrappedHttpClient);		}	    }
